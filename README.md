## About

Our mission is to create intelligent technologies for everyone, everywhere. For computers to be intelligent, they need more than the ability to make sense of the world around them—they need to see the world in AI-IoT. And for intelligent computing to flourish, excellent AI-IoT devices that are affordably priced and universally available will be a necessity. That’s why our team at DeepCounter has developed in the past three years getting our AI-IoT System right—perfecting our DeepCounter family and designing our AI-IoT camera with a built-in, fully functioning computer. We believe that in the future, it will be hard to remember a time when computers didn’t have smart cameras. Whether you call it artificial intelligence, or anticipatory computing, or Deep Learning, or simply intelligent computing like we do, we believe this will be the new baseline for what people expect out of their computing devices.
